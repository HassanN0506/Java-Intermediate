Do NOT use the Arrays.AsList() method to add elements to a list,
because it wastes AT LEAST twice as much memory (bc you're really creating 2 lists).
Instead, always add elements to a list the long way around.

AUTO-CASTING DOES NOT HAPPEN IN COLLECTIONS OR IN MAPS!!!!!
    (must be done explicitly)

Maps in Java:
-Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key & value pairs.

Benefits:
-We can store 2 elements inside each entry of the map
-Searching is very efficient in maps

Types of maps:
-HashMap
-LinkedHashMap
-TreeMap
-HashTable

HashMap:
-Does NOT maintain insertion order (downside)
-Insertion speed and Retrieval speed is the fastest (upside)

LinkedHashMap:
-DOES maintain insertion order (upside)
-Insertion speed is SAME AS HashMap, but Retrieval speed is the slowest (downside)

TreeMap:
-Organized entries in ascending order of keys (upside)
-Insertion speed is slowest (downside)
-Retrieval speed is medium (faster than LinkedHasMap, but slower thanHashMap)

Rules:
-Maps do NOT belong to the Collections framework.
    Therefor, we CANNOT convert a Map to a collection or vice versa.

ex.     Map<String, String> students=new Map<>();
        students.put("Yaz123", "Yazgul");
        Set<String> set=new HashSet(students);
        //ERROR, because java cannot decide which element is a key and which is a key.

-Duplicate Keys are NOT allowed
-Duplicate Values ARE allowed
