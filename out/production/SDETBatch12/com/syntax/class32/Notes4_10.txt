FileHandling in Java:
-Reading and Writing data to files is called "file handling".

Things that we need to read/write data to files:
1) File path - location of the file on the computer.
2) Navigate to tha location - we use FileInputStream if we are reading data,
    and FileOutputStream if we are writing data.
3) A specific class that knows how to read/write data to a specific class
    ex: for ".properties" files, we use Properties class
        for Excel files, we use XSSFWorkbook class
