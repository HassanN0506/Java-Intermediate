Maps in Java:
    -It's a data structure that allows us to store key:value pairs.
    1) Searching is efficient.
    2) We can use any types of keys like Double, String, char, etc. We are not restricted to integer-
        based natural indexes.

There are many types of maps, but we will be discussing only 4 of them.
    1) HashMap  2) LikedHashMap  3) TreeMap  4) HashTable(old)

HashMap:
    1) HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
    2) Insertion order is not maintained.
    3) The most widely-used map.

LinkedHashMap:
    1) LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order
    2) Insertion speed is same as HashMap.
    3) Retrieval Speed, however, is the slowest.

TreeMap:
    1) TreeMap sorts data based on the natural (ascending) order.
    2) Insertion speed is the slowest, because it has to sort.

HashTable:
    HashTable is a "Thread-Safe" data structure, meaning it can handle multiple insertions and
        retrievals at the same time from multiple CPU cores, but because of this thread-safety
        feature, it is also very SLOW. So, if you are sure that you will never write multithreaded
        code, never use it.

FileInputStream is used to READ data from a file
FileOutputStream is used to WRITE data from in file

in .properties files:
- propertiesObject.load() method is used to Load the data from the file to the Properties object
- propertiesObject.store() method is used to Store all the data from the Properties object to the file
-Everytime you go to add on to a file, it Overwrites the ENTIRE file, so you have to make sure to
    LOAD the existing data into the file (again) through your program BEFORE adding anything.
-And the insertion order of the entries is not maintained, because Properties class is a subclass of Hashtable


in .xlsx files:
-no " .load()" method, just pass the fileInputStream object directly into the constructor of this class
